# Hullo!

## Repositories

I do not actually have many repos here or do much work here as all previous jobs have had largely private code! Most originally authored repos are obsolete for one reason or another and most of the rest are there because I was working on a PR for a project or otherwise needed to have a fork available. But here's a summary (as of April 2023) of repos that aren't just very basic forks that I had fun with.

- [chord-decode](https://github.com/ludwick/chord-decode): this is a completely unnecessary command-line tool in Rust that takes a UTF-8 string and determines the underlying Unicode characters and their names. Inspired by the [fontspace unicode analyzer](https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer#e=8J-RrvCfj73igI3imYDvuI8) but written to make myself re-learn (or learn new) things in Rust.
- [reveal.js-mermaid-plugin](https://github.com/ludwick/reveal.js-mermaid-plugin): When you're giving a presentation, you obviously have to write code to customize the code-oriented presentation software you picked over just using PowerPoint.
- [pebble-kexp-now-playing](https://github.com/ludwick/pebble-kexp-now-playing): RIP Pebble! This was a simple app to at the touch of a button display whatever song was currently playing on KEXP by fetching the now playing feed from their website.
- [redis-sentinel-watcher](https://github.com/ludwick/redis-sentinel-watcher): At one point I had an HA redis cluster in Kubernetes and there was a bug detecting pod deletion where the expedient solution was to just tell the sentinels to reset themselves.
